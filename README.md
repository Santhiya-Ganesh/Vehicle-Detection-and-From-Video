Deep learning project
Vehicle Detection and Couting from video

An application that is capable of counting and detecting the vehicle from the video input. The detections are performed on each frame by using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm and displayed on the screen with bounding boxes

#Footage collection
video footage collection to count the number of vehicles in a road at a particular time. 
#Vehicle tracking and detection
Vehicle tracking involves continuously identifying the detected vehicle in video sequence and is done by specifically marking the boundary around the detected vehicle.
#Vehicle counting
The counting method is based on the vehicle regional bounding box marks and the virtual reference line.
#Result analysis
video footage from are collected and analyzed for different time period to predict the average traffic.
